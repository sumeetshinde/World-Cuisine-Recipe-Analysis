Food is not only a necessity but also reflects the culture of the respective society. In this project, we attempt to understand the similarities and differences of various cuisines through the ingredients that go into a particular recipe of that cuisine and what they represent from the perspective of different cultures around the world.

The training dataset is a JSON file containing recipe idâ€™s, cuisine and ingredients with a total of 39774 rows.The recipes are spread across 20 cuisines. We predict the cuisine of a recipe based on its ingredients (Food_Analysis.ipynb). Additionally, I developed a recommender system, recommending a cuisine to the user based on his/her ingredient preference (Recommendation System.ipynb).
